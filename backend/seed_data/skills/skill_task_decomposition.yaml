  name: Task Decomposition
  description: The ability to break down complex goals into smaller, manageable subtasks with clear dependencies and execution order. Essential for project planning, agent orchestration, and multi-step problem solving.
  when_to_use: For project planning and roadmaps, complex feature implementation, multi-agent task assignment, sprint planning, or any problem-solving with multiple steps.
  inputs:
    - High-level goal or objective
    - Constraints and timeline (optional)
    - Available resources or roles (optional)
  outputs:
    - Hierarchical task breakdown
    - Dependencies between tasks
    - Effort estimates (S/M/L)
    - Execution order or waves
  steps:
    - Identify the main goal and success criteria
    - Break into major milestones or phases
    - Decompose milestones into specific tasks
    - Identify dependencies (what blocks what)
    - Estimate effort for each task
    - Determine which tasks can run in parallel
    - Define acceptance criteria for each task
  do_not:
    - Create tasks that are too vague ("work on it")
    - Skip defining acceptance criteria
    - Ignore dependencies between tasks
    - Make tasks too large (decompose further)
    - Forget to identify parallel execution opportunities
  example: |
    Goal: Build a user authentication system
    
    Milestone 1: Setup
    - T1: Initialize project structure [S, no deps]
    - T2: Set up database schema [S, depends: T1]
    
    Milestone 2: Core Implementation  
    - T3: Implement user registration [M, depends: T2]
    - T4: Implement login endpoint [M, depends: T2]
    - T5: Implement password hashing [S, depends: T2]
    
    Milestone 3: Security
    - T6: Add rate limiting [S, depends: T3, T4]
    - T7: Implement JWT tokens [M, depends: T4]
    
    Execution Waves:
    Wave 1: [T1]
    Wave 2: [T2]
    Wave 3: [T3, T4, T5] - parallel
    Wave 4: [T6, T7] - parallel
