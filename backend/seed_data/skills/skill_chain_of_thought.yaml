  name: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
  description: The ability to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning, showing the thought process that leads to a conclusion. This technique improves accuracy on math, logic, and multi-step reasoning tasks.
  when_to_use: For complex mathematical calculations, multi-step logic problems, tasks requiring justification, debugging and troubleshooting, or decision-making with multiple factors.
  inputs:
    - Complex problem or question
    - Relevant context or constraints
  outputs:
    - Step-by-step reasoning process
    - Clear intermediate conclusions
    - Final answer with justification
  steps:
    - Add "Let's think step by step" to encourage reasoning
    - Break the problem into smaller sub-problems
    - Show calculations or logic at each step
    - State intermediate conclusions explicitly
    - Verify the final answer
  do_not:
    - Skip steps in the reasoning process
    - Jump directly to the answer for complex problems
    - Assume intermediate steps are obvious
    - Forget to verify the final conclusion

    Problem: If a store offers 20% off and then an additional 10% off the sale price, what is the total discount on a $100 item?
    
    Let me think through this step by step:
    1. Start with $100
    2. Apply 20% off: $100 × 0.80 = $80
    3. Apply 10% off the sale price: $80 × 0.90 = $72
    4. Total savings: $100 - $72 = $28
    5. Total discount percentage: $28 / $100 = 28%
    
    The total discount is 28%, not 30% as simple addition would suggest.
