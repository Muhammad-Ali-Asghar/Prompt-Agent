  name: Few-Shot Prompting
  description: The technique of providing examples in the prompt to demonstrate the desired task format, style, or behavior. The model learns the pattern from examples and applies it to new inputs.
  when_to_use: When you need custom formatting requirements, specific output styles, domain-specific terminology, consistent behavior across inputs, or classification tasks.
  inputs:
    - Task description
    - 2-5 example input-output pairs
    - New input to process
  outputs:
    - Output following the demonstrated pattern
    - Consistent style with examples
  steps:
    - Choose diverse examples covering different cases
    - Format examples consistently (same structure for all)
    - Use clear delimiters to separate examples
    - Place most relevant examples last (recency effect)
    - Present the new input in the same format
  do_not:
    - Use too many examples (wastes context window)
    - Use inconsistent formatting across examples
    - Forget to show both input AND output for each example
    - Use examples that don't represent the target task
  example: |
    Convert sentences to formal language:
    
    Input: "gonna grab some food"
    Output: "I am going to obtain some food"
    
    Input: "wanna hang out later?"
    Output: "Would you like to spend time together later?"
    
    Input: "that's cool"
    Output: "That is acceptable"
